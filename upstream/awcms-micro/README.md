# AWCMS-Micro Parent Repository

This repository is the parent maintenance workspace for keeping AWCMS-Micro aligned with the latest EmDash source.

## Purpose

Analyze `https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash`, then update `https://github.com/ahliweb/awcms-micro` so it stays fully synchronized with EmDash.

`awcms-micro` is an independent repository. It must not act as a host for other repositories in the product or runtime sense. It should serve as an example implementation that adopts EmDash 100% and includes only example plugins and example templates that follow the AWCMS-Micro standard, without modifying EmDash core.

AWCMS-Micro-specific product development in this maintenance workspace is limited to plugin and template boundaries. Root scripts and root documentation may change to support that workflow, but new product behavior should not be introduced through EmDash core forks or new shared core layers.

## Versioning Model

This workspace uses three separate versioning and changelog surfaces:

- root maintenance changes for the parent repository live in `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and root `.awcms-changesets/`
- workspace package releases for published EmDash packages like `awcmsmicro-dev/packages/admin/` are driven by `awcmsmicro-dev/.changeset/`
- downstream AWCMS-Micro release-note inputs for `@awcms-micro/*` live in `awcmsmicro-dev/.awcms-changesets/`
- plugin packages under `awcmsmicro-dev/packages/plugins/` keep their own `package.json` version and `CHANGELOG.md`
- template packages under `awcmsmicro-dev/templates/` keep their own `package.json` version and `CHANGELOG.md`

`CHANGELOG.md` also carries a workspace snapshot of the current EmDash upstream SHA plus the version and latest changelog entry for every plugin and template in `awcmsmicro-dev/`.

Keep these flows separate so root maintenance releases do not mix with package releases, while the snapshot stays current.

## Licensing

- The root maintenance workspace is MIT licensed. See `LICENSE`.
- AWCMS-Micro example plugins and templates use the AW Non-Commercial License 1.0 from `https://github.com/ahliweb/aw-non-commercial-license`.
- `docs/awcms-micro-licensing.md` explains how the root MIT license and package-level non-commercial license fit together.

## Root Structure

- `emdash-latest/`: latest synchronized snapshot of upstream EmDash
- `awcmsmicro-dev/`: clone of `emdash-latest/` used as the active AWCMS-Micro development workspace
- `docs/`: root-level technical documentation for structure, sync workflow, and implementation rules
- `scripts/`: maintenance scripts for refreshing `emdash-latest/` and rebuilding `awcmsmicro-dev/`

Hidden root files such as `.gitignore` and local-only `.env` support the parent workspace and are not part of the product structure.
Fresh-clone sync bootstrapping may also store template name and built-in plugin choices in `awcmsmicro-dev/.env` so local operator decisions stay outside git, and rebuilds preserve both `awcmsmicro-dev/.env` and `awcmsmicro-dev/.env.age` when present.
See `docs/operator-workflow.md` for the `continuation` and `fresh-clone` update modes and the fresh-clone prompt details.

## Repository Rules

- Keep `emdash-latest/` as the clean upstream reference tree.
- Rebuild `awcmsmicro-dev/` from `emdash-latest/` before AWCMS-Micro-specific implementation work.
- Do not treat this repository as a runtime host for nested products.
- Keep root documentation synchronized with the actual workflow and folder layout.
- Work step by step using small, atomic changes.
- When a task is too large, split it into smaller follow-up tasks or GitHub issues.
- If a downstream source tweak must survive sync but does not belong in a plugin or template boundary, encode it as a patch under `awcmsmicro-dev/.awcms-patches/` so the rebuild script can reapply it automatically.

## Official Language

English (US) is the official repository language for root documentation, root scripts, repository instructions, and AWCMS-Micro-specific repository governance text.

Exception:

- `emdash-latest/` must remain as an upstream-faithful EmDash snapshot and should preserve upstream wording as-is, including non-US spelling when present.
- `awcmsmicro-dev/` may mirror upstream wording when it is rebuilt from `emdash-latest/` as part of synchronization work.

## Backup & Recovery

- `bash scripts/backup/encrypt-config.sh` - Encrypt backup config
- `bash scripts/backup/decrypt-config.sh` - Decrypt backup config
- `bash scripts/backup/encrypt-all-env.sh` - Encrypt all .env files
- `bash scripts/backup/encrypt-env.sh` - Encrypt .env files
- `bash scripts/backup/decrypt-env.sh` - Decrypt .env files
- `bash scripts/backup/backup-db.sh` - Backup database to R2
- `bash scripts/backup/backup-dotfiles.sh` - Backup dotfiles
- `bash scripts/backup/restore-dotfiles.sh` - Restore dotfiles
- `bash scripts/backup/recovery-checklist.sh` - Disaster recovery guide

Backup scripts load encrypted configuration first and then safely overlay local `.env` files when present, which lets operator-only values such as `GITLAB_PAT` stay outside committed config.

See [scripts/backup/README.md](scripts/backup/README.md) for full documentation.

The D1 mirror workflow for DBeaver is documented separately in `docs/awcms-micro-d1-mirror-sync.md`.

## Contribution Policy

## Standard Workflow

1. Refresh `emdash-latest/` from upstream EmDash.
2. Rebuild `awcmsmicro-dev/` from `emdash-latest/` and let the rebuild script reapply any downstream patch overlays from `awcmsmicro-dev/.awcms-patches/`.
3. Validate `awcmsmicro-dev/` with `bash scripts/validate-awcmsmicro-dev.sh`.
4. Implement AWCMS-Micro-specific product work only in approved plugin and template boundaries inside `awcmsmicro-dev/`.
5. Prepare `.awcms-changesets/` entries when AWCMS plugins or templates need downstream version bumps.
6. Update root documentation when structure or process changes.

During rebuilds, `bash scripts/update-awcmsmicro-dev.sh` preserves only the explicitly approved AWCMS-Micro paths listed in `scripts/awcmsmicro-dev-protected-paths.txt` and governed by `docs/awcms-micro-implementation-boundaries.md`, including `awcmsmicro-dev/.changeset/` for workspace package-release metadata.
