# Decision Records

## Purpose

This file is a lightweight index of major AWCMS-Micro repository decisions.

Use it as the shortest entry point when you need to understand why the repository is structured the way it is before reading the full supporting documents.

## Current Decisions

### DR-001: Upstream EmDash Remains The Core Source

- Decision: keep `emdash-latest/` as the upstream-faithful EmDash snapshot and avoid placing AWCMS-Micro product logic there
- Why: preserve clean upstream comparison and low-friction synchronization
- See: `docs/repository-structure.md`, `docs/synchronization-workflow.md`

### DR-002: AWCMS-Micro Product Work Is Plugin-And-Template-Only

- Decision: implement new AWCMS-Micro behavior only through plugin and template boundaries
- Why: avoid creating a second shared core layer parallel to EmDash
- See: `docs/implementation-instructions.md`, `docs/awcms-micro-implementation-boundaries.md`

### DR-003: Root Docs And Scripts Are Governance Surfaces

- Decision: keep root docs and scripts focused on sync workflow, validation, deployment, and governance
- Why: separate maintenance operations from product runtime behavior
- See: `README.md`, `docs/operator-workflow.md`

### DR-004: Promotion To An Independent Repository Is Explicitly Prepared

- Decision: keep sync-safe product-facing README and promotion artifacts at the parent-repository level
- Why: `awcmsmicro-dev/README.md` is rebuilt from upstream and is not the right place for persistent downstream product identity work
- See: `docs/awcms-micro-product-readme-final.md`, `docs/awcms-micro-repository-promotion-checklist.md`, `docs/awcms-micro-release-readiness-checklist.md`

### DR-005: Divergence Must Be Logged And Reviewable

- Decision: maintain compatibility and divergence tracking as explicit governance artifacts
- Why: make downstream changes auditable and easier to review during future syncs
- See: `docs/upstream-sync/DIVERGENCE_LOG.md`, `docs/upstream-sync/COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md`

### DR-006: AWCMS-Micro Uses Its Own Downstream Versioning Flow

- Decision: keep AWCMS-Micro plugin and template versioning separate from upstream EmDash Changesets
- Why: downstream AWCMS release cadence and package set differ from the upstream monorepo release set
- See: `docs/awcms-micro-versioning.md`, `docs/awcms-micro-versioning-rollout-summary.md`

### DR-011: Workspace Package Releases Stay On Changesets

- Decision: keep published workspace packages like `@emdash-cms/admin` on the standard `awcmsmicro-dev/.changeset/` flow, separate from downstream `@awcms-micro/*` release notes
- Why: avoid mixing upstream package release metadata with AWCMS-Micro-specific release boundaries
- See: `docs/awcms-micro-versioning.md`, `docs/awcms-micro-root-versioning.md`

### DR-007: Root Changelog Carries The Workspace Snapshot

- Decision: keep the parent repository root changelog as the authoritative workspace snapshot for the current EmDash SHA and the latest version/changelog entry of every plugin and template in `awcmsmicro-dev/`
- Why: make the current maintenance state visible in one place without modifying `emdash-latest/`
- See: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/awcms-micro-root-versioning.md`

### DR-008: Plugin Placement, Sidebar Grouping, and i18n Rules

- Decision: place active plugin sidebars directly below Dashboard, grouped individually, and require full English default and Indonesian translation capability
- Why: visual isolation and premium localized user experience for plugins, avoiding layout clutter in admin navigation
- See: `docs/implementation-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/upstream-sync/UPSTREAM_PR_PLAN_ADMIN_SIDEBAR_ORDERING.md`

### DR-009: Core Performance Bottlenecks Must Be Escalated Upstream

- Decision: when AWCMS-Micro public performance hotspots remain in upstream-owned EmDash core paths after downstream template cleanup, document and escalate them upstream instead of patching core locally
- Why: preserve the plugin-and-template-only downstream model and keep performance fixes reviewable in the canonical EmDash codebase
- See: `docs/upstream-sync/ISSUE_CLASSIFICATION_DOWNSTREAM_VS_UPSTREAM.md`, `docs/awcms-micro-implementation-boundaries.md`

### DR-010: Plugin-First Admin Navigation Is A Downstream Adaptation

- Decision: render plugin admin groups directly below Dashboard in `awcmsmicro-dev/`, keep each plugin in its own collapsible group, and reuse the same ordering in the command palette
- Why: keep AWCMS-Micro plugin navigation clear and consistent while staying inside downstream admin-shell boundaries
- See: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/implementation-instructions.md`, `docs/upstream-sync/UPSTREAM_PR_PLAN_ADMIN_SIDEBAR_ORDERING.md`

### DR-012: Fresh-Clone Sync Requires Explicit Local Bootstrap Choices

- Decision: distinguish `continuation` and `fresh-clone` update modes, and require fresh-clone runs to capture local bootstrap choices such as template name, built-in plugin usage, and local `.env`-based GitHub/Cloudflare config before sync proceeds
- Why: prevent a new clone from silently inheriting the wrong deployment, naming, or service configuration and keep operator choices outside git
- See: `docs/operator-workflow.md`, `docs/synchronization-workflow.md`, `scripts/sync-preflight-checklist.sh`

### DR-013: Plugin Sidebar Groups Stay Per-Plugin And Alphabetical

- Decision: render plugin admin links as one collapsible group per plugin, order the groups alphabetically by plugin name, mirror the same ordering in the admin command palette, and use contextual page icons from plugin metadata where available
- Why: keep plugin navigation clear, stable across rebuilds, and visually aligned with the content each plugin actually exposes
- See: `packages/admin/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `packages/admin/src/components/AdminCommandPalette.tsx`, `docs/awcms-micro-implementation-boundaries.md`

## How To Extend

When a new repository-shaping decision is introduced:

1. add a short record here
2. update the deeper supporting document
3. update `DIVERGENCE_LOG.md` if the decision creates or retires a meaningful downstream divergence
